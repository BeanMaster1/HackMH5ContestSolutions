Yor the assasin is on the job, but she is a little out of practice. 
This hit was not perfectly planned, and the target is almost about to get away. 
Thankfully, Yor is able to run at superhuman speeds, so if there is a path to her target, she can catch him.

She can only move up, down, left, or right, no diagonals
