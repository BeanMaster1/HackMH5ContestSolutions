The Master Spy, Twilight, has stolen classified Ostanian Military Documents. 
The only issue is, the Ostanian State Security Service (SSS) encrypts all their communications. 
Thankfully, Twilight knows how their cipher works.

First, they convert all characters 'a'-'z' in alpahbetical order to the numbers 0-25

The encryption key K begins with a secret prefix n characters long. Each remaining character in K is copied from the unencrypted plaintext A, so that
K[n+i] = A[i]
for i >= 1

Encryption from plaintext A to ciphertext B follows the follwing formula:
B[i] = A[i] + K[i] mod 26

Twilight was able to see the last n letters of the plaintext by disguising himself as an SSS rookie. However, now he will need to decipher the rest himself.

Input Format

The input consists of:

One line with 2 integers n and m, where n is the length of the number of letters Twilight saw, and m is the length of the document
One line with n lowercase letters, the letters twilight saw
One line with m lowercase letters, the encrypted document

Constraints
1 <= n <= 30
n+1 <= m <= 100
