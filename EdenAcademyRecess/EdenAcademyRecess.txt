Anya and her classmates at Eden Academy are playing a game during recess. 
All N students are standing in a line, with their arms either raised in the air or lowered. They play with the following rules:

Each student watches the student in front of them. When the student in front of them lowers their arms from the air, the student watching does 1 of 2 things:

If the student watching has their arms are in the air, they lower them
Otherwise, they raise their arms in the air

All students start the game with their hands down. The first student in line switches from lowered to raised or from raised to lowered whenever their teacher, Professor Henry Henderson, claps his hands.

Your mission is to figure out, after Professor Henderson claps N times, whether or not all the students have their hands in the air.

Input Format

An integer, T, the number of test cases.

The next T lines contain 2 integers, M (The number of students) and N (How many times Henderson claps)

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100,000
1 <= M <= 30
0 <= N <= 2,147,483,647

Output Format

For each test case:

This should be printed if all students have their hands in the air:
ELEGANT!!!
Otherwise, print
NOT ELEGANT!!!
